    <p><strong>Dear Parent/Guardian,</strong></p>
    <p>May the peace of God Almighty be with you. We thank God for his goodness and mercy that brought us to the end of the term. The demonstration family wishes you a merry Christmas and a prosperous new year.</p>
    <p>We sincerely thank you parents and Guardians for paying your children/wards fees promptly. Those that did not pay on time should do better this term.</p>
    <p>We are constrained to increase the bus fare because of the increase in the price of petrol and cost of maintenance. We also sincerely apologize for the occasional breakdown of our buses. </p>
    <h3 class="text-center text-uppercase">During this term, we achieved the following:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Our SS3 students will sit for their NECO/WAEC Examination.</li>
        <li>We now have our school POS for cash payment in the school.</li>
        <li>Use of phones by students is highly prohibited</li>
        <li>We now have a Wednesday wear, which cost â‚¦4,500 for material and sewing. Those students that do not have the Wednesday wear should get it this term.</li>
        <li>We want to announce that our college has gone online and our students can access their results. Click <a href="{% url 'resultchecker' %}">here</a> to check the result</li>
        <li>You parents can also access the result using the scratch card given to your children.</li>
    </ul>
